# AngularJS-Simple-Application
This application is just to apply some AngularJS basics, I know UI is not that good, but I implemented this application to test only javascript and AngularJS code, Not HTML or CSS.

there are only two files (Home.html & Home.js), simply put these  two files in one folder and start Home.html page.
Import the third file questions.json, this json file contains all questions, I previously implement another python script to create this json file automatically from source (http://www.sanfoundry.com/cplusplus-interview-questions-answers/) (http://www.sanfoundry.com/1000-python-questions-answers/) .
Each question contains score, after answering last question you will see your total score and total correct answered questions.
